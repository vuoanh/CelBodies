# CelBodies
"In this homework, we will create a simulation for celestial bodies, traditionally called a N-body simulation. Given a collection celestial bodies—e.g., planets and stars—calculate their interactive forces and predict their movement. Such a system for arbitrary N has no closed-form solution; we are forced to simulate the motion of the bodies to predict their movements."
